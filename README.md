# OFN-project
OFN σ_crit = π/4 – Replication Package Minimal Python implementation reproducing the critical transition σ_crit = π/4 in the Ontological Fundamental Network (4-vertex cycle). Implements transfer operator, explicit normalization, and σ-parameter. Verifies spectral degeneracy at critical point. Includes tests, notebooks, and Docker.
# OFN σ_crit = π/4 – Replication Package

This repository contains a minimal, self-contained implementation of the Ontological Fundamental Network (OFN) model described in:

> Evdokimov, O. (2026). *OFN Part II: Dynamics, Reading Paths, and the σ-Parameter of Consciousness*.

It reproduces the critical transition σ_crit = π/4 on a 4-vertex directed cycle.
